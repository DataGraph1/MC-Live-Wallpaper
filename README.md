# MC-Live-Wallpaper

This is a python script to change your wallpaper to a Minecraft screenshot with equivalent in game time, to real life time. Please keep in mind this was originally just a quick script I made for myself to learn some coding, so isn't coded the best. Thanks to Doomcow500 for helping to clean up my code and make it easier for others to use.

7. Uzip and put all files and folders into the same folder (there should be 4 files and a folder with 1439 images)
